				"description": `Again this over-familiar feeling, the feeling of relief and joy, happiness and mirth. I feel more and more relieved of all anxiety, fear, fury and hatred. I'm the only one here and I'll remain alone. There is not a single person, no creature in the world, that can make me feel that lovely way. This feeling, however, is not love. Love is just a mirage that people pursue all their lives, thinking that in this way they will understand the meaning of life. My "love" does not resemble the true meaning of the word. I experience my moments differently from the rest... Here again, another drop of blood stained my slightly white pants, which they gifted to me. After that, several others followed it and they were the last ones. Only the trace of my "accident" remained, as the others would call it. There were traces of the previous times, but through this I tried to keep the sensation longer than usual. I decided to lift the bar and continue to push until I felt the hot spring of blood flowing from everywhere. It was incredible... The feeling of salvation from all sorts of remorse and anxiety. I was able to figure out which instrument helped me to embark on this unforgettable and definitely repeatable experience - the razor blade. I used the most valuable one I had (I managed to conceal it from everybody who tried to separate it from me) - a personal gift from the vocalist of British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It embellished the whole picture I was able to describe through my actions.<br><br>

					I have noticed that people do not want to try to understand the others, but rather get a first impression of them, through which they will present you to the world, without thinking about in what position they are placing you. In my case, people worry about me because based on my appearance and actions, they seem to conclude that I have some sort of mentally ill state of deep depression, which often leads to suicide and needs to be taken care of sooner rather than too late. This is my diagnosis prescribed by the public. I'm glad that this time, at least for me, they are right, though only partly... One thing they do not understand is the fact that depression is not within certain people, it is in everyone, but it just takes time to unlock it. This "depression" hangs on people and gradually "eats" them from within. Salvation is difficult to achieve, but it can still be possible. But no matter how successful it is, at one point, this "monster" comes back again, and this time it inflicts a far fiercer and fatal blow. Ultimately, this depression affects people very negatively by making them close themselves from the world and that always leads to being very unhappy, not missing the chance of harming them not physically but psychologically. But people do not notice a very important detail of my “prescription” - it gives me a great pleasure to live with my depression and "raise" it, as it has "raised" me all my life. I feel perfect by self-harming myself physically regardless of which aspect. The only thing I hate is the people and their contemptuous behavior towards others. On the other hand, this way I too express my contemptuous attitude towards society, but in my situation it is not just in theory. To some extent, I cannot say that I only feed with my thirst for self-harm, yet I'm a human too, I experience normal human needs, just like others. The problem with me, however, is that I am not that type of a person who would be educated to be able to prosper in life. I did not graduate from high school, I left it when I was 16. My solution to my problems was the only one I found. Not to work somewhere and be miserable, I started stealing. Theft after theft and I became better at this initiative. But only up until then... The last time while I was in a bank and kindly fulfilling my duties, one of the guards came in the road and I had to act instinctively. I put an end to his life and I fled. I did not feel fear. I did not feel anxiety or remorse. I felt free. Still, I did not expect this action to affect me, but it seems just the opposite. I can now officially call myself a “serial killer”, I guess. I was not being picky... Whoever stood on the road was stripped of his existence, and this happened in a different manner every time. One time with a knife, sometimes with more inventive ideas, such as closing a man in a trap room. The only way for a man to escape was to get out of the room he was in. The catch was that I gave, but I wanted something in return as well. He had to get out of treacherous obstacles, and for this purpose the martyr should sacrifice some parts of himself, otherwise he would not find salvation, but only eternal peace in his endless dream. Perhaps my most successful hit was when I had to kidnap and torture for a long time in any possible way the President of the United States. Do not ask me how I caught him, just accept that I also have people, and I know how to make contacts here and there. Since then, things have been tightened, I have been pursued from every possible state, and I am just sitting in the corner of the room, stretching out my arm and preparing for my escape... My wishes, however, have nothing to do with that escape. I have no intention of hiding all my life for trying to reveal my personality through my actions. I want eternal peace, and there is no such thing in life. So that is why I found a substitute - my razor blade, but it still wasn’t enough. Obviously this is a type of narcotic or something like that. I decided to try to get as close as possible to my "freedom"... The next cut was the opposite direction - along the arm, starting from the wrist and going along the path of the vein. It was my last moment of splendor and magic. Blood slid out of my hand, filling the empty room I was in. I even managed to get my pants dirty again... I descended to the ground with my head going on one side and froze. For a moment I felt the cold, then again a soft burning heat. For some, though brief time, I really felt at peace... My end came, but at least it was expressed through my type of art – “The Art of Loneliness”.<br><br>

					One of the many things,<br>
					that have not proven their existence.<br>
					The only anomaly that awakens in people the infinite,<br>
					and precious thirst for existence.<br>
					<br>
					This is the power that fits deep within you<br>
					So deep that even you would not realize<br>
					how important it is to you<br>
					<br>
					This is the "creature" you expect around the clock<br>
					which leaves you breathless and raptured<br>
					Its invulnerability makes it truly unmistakable,<br>
					and its beauty is far from a comparison<br>
					<br>
					For some this is a fiction,<br>
					but I refuted its existence.<br>
					Once it was just a lovely fairy tale,<br>
					but now - a crystal clear reality.<br>
					<br>
					This vortex, so strange and unexplored.<br>
					So refreshing and at the same time frightening.<br>
					Who would have misjudged it?!<br>
					Definitely not me!<br>
					<br>
					But, as I happened to see it again,<br>
					It took that it was leaving far from me.<br>
					Appearance - extraterrestrial.<br>
					Charm - disarming a whole army.<br>
					Eyes - so sincere, but secretive<br>
					Smile - chillingly magnificent.<br>
					<br>
					This is Her! But she is a lot more than that!<br>
					She is the one people call God.<br>
					She is the one you do not dare to touch,<br>
					not knowing if it will be your last before you lose her forever.<br>
					She is the one that makes you restless<br>
					and the one that constantly lurks in your thoughts.<br>
					She is the one who in the evening puts you gently to sleep,<br>
					and in the morning wakes you cheerfully.<br>
					She is the one without which I cannot.<br>
					It is she who brought me to this madness.<br>
					It is she the one that fills the gap in me.<br>
					Without her I am nobody... Just a man<br>
					who has gone looking for his own God.<br>
					<br>
					And here I am now... I wonder why I'm always like this...<br>
					Always silent and shy...<br>
					Not daring to take the first step...<br>
					This is my sin that has no redemption...<br>
					One wrong action and everything collapses...<br>
					<br>
					It happened today... The internal destruction in me.<br>
					The fear that has arisen from our most recent encounter.<br>
					The fact that inaction and fear prevailed<br>
					and silence took the floor<br>
					was the proof of my weakness<br>
					<br>
					Unbelievable... How inconsiderate of me...<br>
					Obviously I will still remain a silent lamb in the herd...<br>`,
